## NOTE

#### Stationary Testbed:
+ UCB and Optimistic Greedy takes more than 2000 runs get graph similar to that presented in the book
+ Need to check again ?

#### Non-Stationary Testbed
+ To obtain results of horizon 100_000 with 200_000 runs is very time consuming, with my computer I was not able to perform such experiment
+ Will try this when I get access to GPU ?
